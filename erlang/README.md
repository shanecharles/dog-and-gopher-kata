# Dog and Gopher (partial erlang)

This implementation is not yet fully functional.
What's missing?
* parsing the input file
* executing on multiple data sets

The test data sets are currently hard coded. I will add the ability to parse an input file.

## Running

Load the `dog_gopher` module in the erlang runtime and execute:

    dog_gopher:run_sets().
